# K means Clustering
Clustering Analysis on Cervical Cancer Dataset using K-means method


## Overview
The data for this analysis was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, namely the [Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29). The dataset was collected at the 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, and consisted of demographic information, habits, and historical medical records from 858 patients. Some patients decided not to answer some questions because of privacy concerns so that there were missing values in several variables. The variables used in this study are 7 variables with integer and float data types.
